## **Specifications**._Definitions_.**_`Emblem`_**

1.	**emblem** `MUST` mean the main subject of this document, which itself is a `software` and a `programming language` for making other software.

2.	**emb** `MUST` mean the `file extension` name for the `raw source-code` file of this programming language (`emblem`). For example, `myProgram.emb`.

3.	**lem** `MUST` mean the `file extension` name for the `compiled` `object-code` or `byte-code` file for this programming language (`emblem`). For example, `MySub.lem`.

4.	**emble** `MUST` mean the `file extension` name for the `layout` file, especially for `GUI Application`, having the layout design separated from the main logic. For example, `styles.emble`.

5.	**ble** _/b - leh/_ `MUST` mean the `file extension` name for `configuration files`, that `MAY` be used during `code-writing`, `compilations` or `runtime-executions`. For example, `configs.ble`.

6.	**eViM** _/e - v - m/_ or _/e - vim/_ `MUST` mean the **`E`mblem `Vi`rtual `M`achine**, it `SHOULD` serve as a `virtual environment` for running `Emblem Applications` and others created hereafter.

7.	**embex** _/em - ex/_, _/m - x/_ or _/emex/_ `MUST` mean the **`emb`lem `ex`ecutable**, which `MUST` be a file containing; `one` or `several` `.emb` or `.lem` file(s), `MAY` contain `one` or `several` `.emble` or `.ble` files too, and in addition it `MAY` contain other necessary files. `.embex` `MAY` also serve as the `file extension` name for the emblem executables. For example, `calculator.embex`.

8.	**mx** `MAY` serve as an `alternative file extension` name for `emblem executables`. For example, `math.mx`.

9.	**emex** `MAY` serve as an `alternative file extension` name for `emblem executables`. For example, `fileManager.emex`.

10.	**librem** `MUST` mean **`L`anguage `I`ntegration `Br`idge for `Em`blem**. A `virtual runtime environment` running `on top` of `eViM`, it `SHOULD` enable `emblem` process and run programs or codes written in other programming languages, and it `SHOULD` be `implemented` in other programming languages to enable `emblem` run in them.

11.	**emapps** `MUST` mean **`Em`blem `App`lication `S`uites**, a place (might be a shortcut icon, a CLI program, a GUI program) where every `installed emblem application` could be found at in the device containing `emblem`. It is an `Applications Manager` for `end-user(s)` and developers, it makes accessibility to `emblem applications` easy.

12.	**eas** _/e&#0225;s/_ `MUST` mean **`E`mblem `A`pplications `S`tore**, An `online repository` for programs made using `Emblem Programming Language`, for easy sharing and marketing.

13.	**edtk** `MUST` mean **`e`mblem `d`ebugging `t`ool`k`it**, As the name suggests, it `SHOULD` serve as a tool for `finding` and `removing` `bugs` from `codes` (most especially `emblem codes`), it `SHOULD` also serve as a tool for `testing`, `profiling` and checking out `program`/`code` `coverages`.

14.	**ess** `MUST` mean **`e`mblem `s`erver `s`cript**, which is a `file extension` name for files containing `emblem programming language` codes meant to be used through `web servers`. Though, it `MAY` contain other programming languages codes too.

15.	**ews** `MUST` mean the **`e`mblem `w`eb `s`erver**, which is a `virtual runtime environment` running `on top` of the `eViM` (or the `librem` especially for other programming languages implementations), it processes `.ess` files and `MAY` return results where necessary. It `SHOULD` by default listen to port `3625` for `plain` or `normal` connections and port `2536` for `secured` connections.

16.	**Pencil Script** are unlike the `emble` layout files that are mostly `static GUI` created at runtime, this `pencil script` `SHOULD` give the developers a full-fledge access to `dynamic GUI` manipulation components, by unlocking the platform's independent hardware capabilities.
